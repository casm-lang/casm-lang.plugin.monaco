* casm-lang.plugin.monaco

CASM language extension integration for the language client [[https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor][monaco-editor]], 
which is based on the example project from the [[https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient/tree/master/example][monaco-languageclient]]
module and some examples from the [[https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor-samples][monaco-editor-samples]] project. 
Besides the language client, this projects also provides a language server dispatcher,
which calls the CASM language server/service daemon (=casmd=) application process 
where the [[https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol][language server protocol]] (LSP) is implemented.
